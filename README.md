# 🧠 AI-Powered Nanoparticle Synthesis & Analysis..
### A Collaborative Project between the Biomedical and Software Engineering Departments
### A sustainable approach to nanotechnology using green synthesis and artificial intelligence.

---

## 🌿 Overview
This capstone project brings together **green nanotechnology** and **artificial intelligence** to create a complete system that can both **synthesize** and **analyze nanoparticles**.

- The **Biomedical Engineering Department** focuses on **green synthesis** of nanoparticles and generating **SEM images** for analysis.  
- The **Software Engineering Department** develops **AI-powered tools** that automatically analyze these images to identify nanoparticle **shape**, **size**, and **distribution**.

Together, these two components demonstrate how **AI can accelerate materials research** and **sustainable nanotechnology**.
